# About Me

<br>

**Name**: Nicholas Vietto  

<br>

**PhD Candidate** at the University of Nebraska - Omaha 

<br>

**Research Interests**: Biopsychosocial Criminology, Quantitative Methods, Data Visualization, Open-Science, Open-Source Software 

<br>


## Introduction

<br>

**Goal:** 

Classify delinquency risk at age 15 using data from ages 9 and 15 in the [[Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS)]{.libre .ffcws}](https://ffcws.princeton.edu/).

<br>

**How:**

Building on the findings and method of Chan et al. (2023), we implement a feed-forward neural network using the [[{tidymodels}]{.tidymodel}](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework in [R]{.R}.

Using a model with factors that included [social]{.purple}, [psychological]{.green}, and [biological]{.blue3} domains, outperformed models using any single domain in predicting a CD diagnosis with 91.18% accuracy.

## Extending Chan and Colleagues (2023)

<br>



Using [[Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS)]{.libre .ffcws}](https://ffcws.princeton.edu/):

<br>

::: {.nonincremental}

* [Expanded Sociological Domain]{.fragment .rgb}: Incorporates rich socio-environmental predictors, including census tract variables, labor market and proximity to gun-violence incidents.

* [Incorporating Genetic Data]{.fragment .rgb}: Specifically, incorporate genes involved in the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways to examine the role of polymorphic variation.

* [Classifying Delinquency Risk]{.fragment .rgb} rather than a CD diagnosis.

![](images/ffcws.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes

The Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) is based on a stratified, multistage sample of about 5,000 children born in large U.S. cities (population over 200,000) between 1998 and 2000, where births to unmarried mothers were oversampled by a ratio of 3 to 1. This sampling strategy resulted in the inclusion of a large number of Black, Hispanic, and low-income families.

## Why Machine Learning?
### Improvements in Empirical Analysis

<br>

::: {.small-text}

* **Advanced Data Processing**: Efficiently handles and analyzes large amounts of data to enhance predictive power.  


* **Uncovering Complex Relationships**: Identifies non-linear and higher-order interactions, especially in high-dimensional datasets, providing deeper insights into variable relationships (e.g., high dimensional data like image, audio, etc.).



* **Enhanced Predictive Accuracy**: Continuously refines predictions through iterative learning, improving overall accuracy over time.

* Further Reading: [Mapping of machine learning approaches for description, prediction, and causal inference in the social and health sciences](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk1942)

**FFNN**

 Each neuron computes a weighted sum of the previous layer's neurons using an activation function, and weights are adjusted through backpropagation to minimize output error.

## Limitations 


<br>

::: {.nonincremental}

* [**Genetic Data Constraints:**]{.fragment .rgb} Genetic information is confined to markers from the candidate gene era, potentially limiting genomic coverage.    

* [**Sample Size:**]{.fragment .rgb} The relatively small sample size may impact the robustness and generalizability typical for machine learning applications.  

* [**Age of Assessment:**]{.fragment .rgb} Age 15 may be early for assessing delinquency risk, as behaviors predictive of long-term patterns may not yet be fully evident.   

:::


## Future Directions

<br>

::: {.nonincremental}

* [**Enhance Domain Optimization:**]{.fragment .rgb} Add features to maximize the model's performance in each specific domain (e.g., adding labor markets for distal predictors in the sociological domain).    

* [**Evaluate Fairness Across Ethnicities:**]{.fragment .rgb} Assess the final model’s performance across different ethnic groups to ensure fairness, verifying it does not exhibit biases against social or minority groups.    

* [**Test model on Year 22 data:**]{.fragment .rgb} Validate the model's performance on the Year 22 data to assess its generalizability and predictive power.

## Supplemental Materials
### Neural Networks 

![](images/nn.png){fig-align="center"}

::: notes

**Natural**

- When we learn new things, our brain forms new connections between neurons, in other words the more the learn or use that particular neuron, the strong the connection becomes between neurons.

**Artificial**

- Just like a natural neural network, an artificial neural network the connections between the nodes (weights) become stronger or weaker based on the training (or learning).
